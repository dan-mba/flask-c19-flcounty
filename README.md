#### This project is no longer in development due to API restrictions

### `/plot-server`
This directory contains the flask aplication which will serve the site and generate the graphs. 
It is built using the Python Flask library to serve pages & handle the REST API. 
The graphs are built using Pandas to manipulate the data & Matplotlib to plot it.

### `/front-end`
This is a simple React app to display the select box to choose the county & display the graphs.
